<!--:en-->I ordered an apartment cleaning service when I move out with agreed price 1600 SEK after tax deduction. I just try to avoid dealing with landlord's complains. 

While when I received the invoice, the price was more then doubled. I asked the reason why. They said that the apartment was unusual dirty and the landlord asked doing extra cleaning work. 

While in my mind the apartment was absolute cleared with basic sweep. If the apartment was totally cleaning, why should I order a cleaning service. I also did not authorized the landlord to order extra cleaning work. And I also did not get question if doing extra cleaning is OK. Why did not you contact me that you can not cleaning with the agreed price, or even said that you need extra money for the service. That should be done before the cleaning.

Then they said that we don't time to contact you. And you don't speak Swedish. 

I replied that I never said I don't speak Swedish. I only said my Swedish is bad. I at least can understand yes or no in Swedish. Actually we had some email communication in Swedish. 

A colleague helped to ask <a href="http://www.konsumentverket.se/" title="Konsumentverkets">Konsumentverkets</a>, what should I do in this case. Konsumentverkets replied that you could pay the money you agreed on, if they want get more, they can appeal.

Then I just replied that I will only pay the amount I agreed and paid it.

They made a call to me later, speak Swedish mixed English. I don't under one key word which he spoke quite many times.

Then it was silent for a week before I received an SMS. They claimed that if I don't pay the full amount they claimed, they will report to Kronofogden. 

I called <a href="http://kronofogden.se/bluffakturor.html" title="Kronofogden">Kronofogden </a>for advice. The lady answered that. They can report to Kronofogden. Then Kronofogden will contact me. I can refuse to pay. Then they can appeal in court if they want.

Now I am waiting for the next step. 

They claimed that no hidden cost in <a href="http://www.stadlistan.se/c/r%C3%B6deby/r%C3%B6deby-st%C3%A4dservice/1111947218" title="Ad">Ad</a>

I shared this case to couple friends. One friend said just give it up, it's totally waste of energy. Another friend said that you can flight for it if you really want to.

Why should I spend energy on this? I don't liked to be fooooled. <!--:--><!--:zh-->上次搬家时请了清理公司清理。报价为退税后1600。我实在是不想到时候房东检查的时候说这个不行那个不行。

当我收到账单的时候，价格居然翻倍还不止。我就发邮件问他们为啥。他们说公寓不是一般的脏，他们还作了房东要求的额外的清理工作。

对我来说，公寓当时把东西已经全部清理出去了，把房间大致清扫了一下。如果公寓完全清洁的，我还需要请清洁服务吗？我没有授权房东可以要求额外的工作。我也没有收到任何邮件、短消息、电话，说额外的工作是否可以。为什么你们开始清洁之前不说，这个价格我们作不了，如果要我们清洁需要加钱。

他们就说，联系你时间来不及。你也不会瑞典语。

我回邮件说，我从来没有说我不会瑞典语，我只说过我的瑞典语差。开始清理之前邮件也有用瑞典语的。

一个同事帮忙咨询了Konsumentverkets，类似315，像这种事情，我应该怎么处理。315说，你可以支付你同意的部分，其它的部分他们可以去申诉。

我就发邮件说我只会付先前同意的部分，通过转帐支付了。

他们给我打了个电话，瑞典语夹杂英语。其中有一个他说了n遍的关键词没听懂。

就这样安静了一个星期，然后我收到一个SMS。他们说如果我不按他们要求全额支付，他们会报到Kronofogden，一个债务处理机构。

我打电话给Kronofogden。接电话的女士相当友善，和我原先从hemnet理解的Kronofogden完全不一样。回答和315完全一致。

现在我就在等下一步了。

在他们广告中，声明没有隐性收费http://www.stadlistan.se/c/r%C3%B6deby/r%C3%B6deby-st%C3%A4dservice/1111947218.

和几个朋友说了一下这件事。有一个说，就这么一点钱完全没有必要浪费精力。有一个说，你要实在想的话，可以。

为什么我非得这么干呢？我不想被耍了
