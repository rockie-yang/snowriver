人或多或少都有些完美主义。完美主义又可分为两种，要求他人完美和要求自己完美。大部分人都是要求他人完美多于要求自己完美。

老爸在老家盖了一栋房子。前几天回家过年，看到房子总感觉不爽。窗户太多，家具就不太好放。楼层太高，买不到这么长的窗帘，换个灯泡还得用梯子。阁楼楼梯太矮，上去的时候的弯腰。有时候没有自来水。

作为程序员，经常碰到需要维护他人的代码。经常抱怨别人的代码写的差，写得复杂，写得难懂。 自己写的代码也会被他人维护 。 也经常被别人骂，那写的是啥吗，当然自己是听不到的。

有时在想，为什么很多小国家有很多了不起的公司，能出来很多了不起的产品。而中国诺大一个国家，却并没有多少。这段时间在瑞典工作，感受瑞典人的个人能力，工作方式，工作态度。瑞典只有一小部分人的个人能力比较强，大部分人的个人能力很一般，但是他们却有象 Volvo ， Ericsson ， ABB ， IKEA 这许多国际性的大公司。

瑞典人没有我们那么多的抱怨，那么多的想法。他们有一个东西之后，大家能够群策群力持续的改进它。看到一个模块设计不好我们最可能是先抱怨抱怨，实在受不了了就自己再写一个不比别人好的模块。

想想老爸也实在不容易，房子虽然盖的有缺点，但是比较还能住。

还是应该少抱怨抱怨。至少应该在抱怨之前想想能否比别人做的更好。

 

Human being is Perfectionist more or less. Perfectionist personality can be divided to two types, self-oriented perfectionist and the request for a perfect driving force completely out of their own. Most people want others perfect more than want their own. At least I am.

My father built a house at my home town. I went home town few days spending Spring Festival. Sometimes I even wanted getting out of the house. I was feeling that the house was not designed and built well. There are too many windows so that it is hard for decoration. Floors are too high so that I could not find suitable curtains; it is very hard to change a light. Space of stairs to the attic is too low so that I have to bend to go to the attic.

As a developer, I need to maintain modules design by others. It is very easy for me to complain that the module were design bad, complex and hard to understand. Others also maintain modules designed by me. Of course, it is complained by others.
 
My father was done well. Other developers were done well. Perhaps I should do more and complain less.
