<!--:en-->I have to learn Swedish now. Otherwise it's really inconvenience.  Although I did not meet any Swedes do not speak English at all. But everything by default is in Swedish. SMS send in Swedish; email send in Swedish, voice instruction in Swedish.

I learn by myself now using Rosetta Stone. 
I will attend one to one Swedish course hold by Folk Universitet (People's University). It is very expensive. Fortunately it is paid by company.
Already applied SFI (Swedish for Immigrant), have not get interviewed.

I hold that I can understand topics people talking about after one year.

I had heard that some westerners learning Chinese only by listening and speaking. I really think that would not work well. 

Because Chinese pronunciation is no clue at all for westerner. But Chinese writing should be quite easy to start. There are some simple Chinese characters were designed according to how things look like. Then many other Chinese characters are composed using those simple vision Chinese characters. <!--:--><!--:zh-->我必须得学瑞典语了。虽然几乎每个瑞典人都会说英语，但是所有的东西默认都是瑞典语的。什么地方的标志都是瑞典语的；语音电话是瑞典语的；车上语音报站是瑞典语的；同事开会间隙也说瑞典语。

现在用Rosetta Stone自学。每天自学半个小时。
瑞典夏天休假结束后就去参加一对一的瑞典语培训。贵啊！幸亏是公司出钱，就算这样我都心疼。
免费的瑞典语培训SFI（Swedish For Immigrant）已经申请了。上次面试错过了没去成，不知道下次面试要到什么时候了。

希望一年之后能够听懂别人在聊什么主题。<!--:-->
